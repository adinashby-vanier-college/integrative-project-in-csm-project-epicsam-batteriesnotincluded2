# Winter 2025 Integrative Project - Mechanics Simulation

For our integrative project, we have decided to do a Mechanics Simulation that will include topics such as Kinematics, Energy, Forces, and Momentum.

## MECHANICS SIMULATION

This project is designed to help mechanics students better understand the four main concepts of the NYA mechanics course,
namely momentum, forces, energy and kinematics

### HOW TO USE

Make an account and login. You need an account to run the simulations.

### MOMENTUM SIMULATION

This displays concepts in momentum such as conservation of momentum and impulse. User selects a number of balls,
their masses and speeds, and set them off to collide into each other. User will be able to see data displayed such
as graph representation of the change of momentum vs time of each of the balls.

### FORCES SIMULATION

This displays concepts in forces such as vector summation. User can spawn a number of vector arrows, which will then 
be summed up into a combined vector that acts on a box. The user can then see data such as equations that calculate 
forces in the x and y components.

### ENERGY SIMULATION

This displays concepts in energy such as kinetic and potential energy. The simulation features a figure on a skateboard skating along
a terrain. The user can input a mathematical function to control how the terrain is formed, which then the figure on the skateboard  will
follow. As the figure skates, Changes in energy will be displayed.

### KINEMATICS SIMULATION

This displays concepts in kinematics such as projectile motion. User can choose either 1D or 2D simulations, then the 
user can select different parameters such as launch angle, height of launch, velocity and gravity. The user can then run 
the simulation to which the object will be launched, and then data such as graph representation of position vs time will 
be displayed to the user.
